This is a project that will demonstrate our abilities and knowledge 
in inheritance, polymorphism, and class hierarchy. This project will 
have an array of different vehicles and be able to display different 
types of information of the vehicle array based on what command you
type into the program.

The package in this project is called edu.uga.cs1302.vehicles.
All Java classes have this package declaration at the top of the
source file. All of the source files are placed in the directory
edu/uga/cs1302/vehicles (in the src directory).

To compile this project, type:

$ javac -d classes src/edu/uga/cs1302/vehicles/*.java

and to run it, you need to provide the fully-qualified name
of the class with the main method:

$ java edu.uga.cs1302.vehicles.Test

Your CLASSPATH must include the ./classes directory.
Alternatively, you may provide the -cp option:

$ java -cp classes edu.uga.cs1302.vehicles.Test
